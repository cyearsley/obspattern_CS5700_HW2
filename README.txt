Estimated Time Worked On: 32 hours

Public IP Address for AWS server: 54.213.214.150 (I have left the server going for your testing needs)
NOTE: if the server is not active, please let me know (in case the instance stops for whatever reason).

How to use the application:
1) Starting it up:
	i) When you start the application, you can decide to create or load a portfolio.
	ii) A defult portfolio is provided for your convenience to test this out (defultPortfolio.txt).
	iii) You can then add/modify stocks to your portfolio (second window).
	iv) On the third window, you can enter a port and/or an IP address to listen on.
		The public IP address for the aws server is provided above.

2) Usinng the app
	i) The only functional button at the moment is: "Stock Prices" (shows a grid of all current prices for the stocks in the portfolio).
	ii) To delete a panel, simply click on the empty whitespace (that is the panel). Don't click on the listBox.
		You may have to exercise your right mouse button a little, this feature is a little glitchy.
	iii) You can save the portfolio you have created by clicking the "Save Portfolio" button.
		The saved file will be named "savedFile.txt" in the projects folder.
